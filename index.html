                    From design to development, I make workflow management, gig economy and freelance 
                    applications. My aim is to help those in tech learn, stay organized, and 
                    get paid while they work to build professional qualifications. 
                    
                    Ten years working in SaaS (Software as a service) and IT has helped me become a user-centric developer.
                    Adaptive web design and easy navigation rank high on my list of importance.
                    My approach is to see the over-arching goal of a company or clients challenge and to compose the most efficient way there. 
                    This portfolio was developed with just HTML, SASS and JavaScript.
